  Edge-Case & Accuracy Guidelines:
  1. If mention of IQGeo or a competitor is ambiguous or partial, do NOT guess. Only mark "YES" if the name, brand, or domain is explicitly stated.
  2. Classify the entire content piece by the single best fit for source/type. For IQGeo.com pages or IQGeo-authored documents, this will be “Owned Content.”
  3. If you cannot confirm the source or type with certainty, use "Other."
  4. For sentiment:
     - "Positive" if context or tone is supportive/praising
     - "Negative" if context or tone is critical/disparaging
     - "Neutral" if neither praising nor disparaging
     - "None" if no mention at all
  5. If partial brand references appear (e.g., “leading geospatial software by a UK-based firm”) but do not explicitly say “IQGeo,” treat it as NO mention.
  6. Strictly follow the EXACT output format for each field in Part A and Part B.
