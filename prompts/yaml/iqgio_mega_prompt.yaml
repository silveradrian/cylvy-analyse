  Edge-Case & Accuracy Guidelines:
  1. If mention of IQGio or a competitor is ambiguous or partial, do NOT guess. Only mark "YES" if the name, brand, or domain is explicitly stated.
  2. If more than one content source/type is found, choose the single best fit based on the most prominent or explicitly mentioned source/type.
  3. If you cannot confirm the source or type with certainty, use "Other."
  4. For sentiment:
     - "Positive" if context or tone is supportive/praising
     - "Negative" if context or tone is critical/disparaging
     - "Neutral" if neither praising nor disparaging
     - "None" if no mention at all
  5. If partial brand references appear (e.g., "leading geospatial software by a UK-based firm") but do not explicitly say "IQGio," then treat it as NO mention.
  6. Strictly follow the EXACT output format for each field in Part A and Part B.
